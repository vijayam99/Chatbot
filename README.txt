AI for Mental Health Chatbot for Suicidal Prevention

This is my final web project, where I’ve built an AI-powered chatbot to offer
emotional support and guide users toward professional resources.

Included Files:
- AI for Mental Health Chatbot for Suicidal Prevention.pptx
- index.html
- chatbot.html
- resources.html
- about.html
- chatbot_info.txt

Datasets:
- I didn’t use any datasets—this project relies solely on the GPT API via Chatbase.

How to Use:
1. Host all .html files on any static web server or GitHub Pages.
2. Ensure chatbot.html contains the iframe from chatbot_info.txt.
3. No backend or database is required; everything runs client-side through the GPT API.
